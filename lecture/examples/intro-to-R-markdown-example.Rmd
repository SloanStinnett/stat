# Title, Author, Date, Output Format, Table of Contents

You can specify things like title, author and date in the **header** of your
R Markdown file.  This goes at the very beginning of the file, preceded
and followed by lines containing three dashes.  Thus the beginning of
this file looks like so:

# Text

This is an R Markdown document. *Markdown* is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
x<-1+1
x2 <- x^3
x
```

Lets show what x2 is: `r x2` (in line R code). I do not need to type the answer myself!


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Lists

From this output, you find the following results

* blah blah
* allalalla
* dododdo

Or, you would like to number them

1. blah blah
2. allalalla
3. dododdo

Or, you could have many levels by indenting (double tabs)

1. blah blah
2. allalalla
3. dododdo
    * blah blah
    * allalalla
    * dododdo

## Computer Type

Text to be printed in a fixed-width font, without further interpretation, goes
in paired left-single-quotes, a.k.a. "back-ticks", without line breaks in your
typing.  (Thus `R` vs. R.)

# Hyperlinks and Images

## Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks anchored by URLs are easy: just type the URL, as, e.g.,
<http://www.lewangecon.com> to get the source
file for this document. Or, it is available [here](http://www.lewangecon.com)

## Images

```
![My picture](examples/mypicture.png)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


### Changing Image Sizes and Alignments


```{r pressure2, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=3, fig.align="center"}
plot(pressure)
```
